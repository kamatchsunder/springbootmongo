Before staring the application 

install docker by using the following link

To know more about docker , I highly recommend visiting the site  

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
 
and then ,

https://docs.docker.com/install/

And then 

use the following command 

1. docker-compose up -d
2. docker-compose ps  (to see the status of the container)
